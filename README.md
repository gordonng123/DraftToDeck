# DraftToDeck

This is Nathaniel Gordon's final project for CS4100, Artificial Intelligence.

## Abstract

The booster draft format is a widely popular format in both the physical and digital variations of popular trading card game Magic: The Gathering. In this paper, the deck-construction component of the booster draft play format is formatted as a combinatorial optimization problem. Both an evaluation function and several heuristic-based optimization schemes for generating solutions the problem are proposed. Experimentally-generated decks produced by applying annealing and genetic evolution methods to human-generated draft pools were shown outperform a random control in a variety of critical metrics, including optimal mana cost curve and expert-informed card rankings.
